# EpicFlow, v1.00 (Revaud)

Our code is mentioned only for scientific or personal use.
Please contact us for commercial use.

### Compiling ###

Simply type 'make' and the code must compile.
Libraries libpng, libjpg, libm and liblapack are required.
You may have compilation due to lapack, eventually add -L<path> to LDFLAGS in Makefile.
If you have compilation issue, probably due to lapack, add -L<path> to LDFLAGS in Makefile 
or use the static version: epicflow-static.
The program was only tested under a 64-bit Linux distribution.
We do not give any support for compilation issues or other OS.

### Prerequisities ###

Given two images, you need first to compute edges and matches before running EpicFlow.
You can download the code from these links.
- for edges using SED:  http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/389109f6-b4e8-404c-84bf-239f7cbf4e3d/
- that will require also Piotr Dollar's toolbox:  http://vision.ucsd.edu/~pdollar/toolbox/doc/index.html
- for matches using Deep Matching:  http://lear.inrialpes.fr/people/revaud

Note that we initially use the first version of SED, whose results are computed using the corresponding model 'modelFinal.mat'. 
More recent versions give similar performance.

### Usage ###

EpicFlow creates a .flo file in an usual .flo format
(for instance, see Middlebury dataset for code reading/displaying it). 

Type "./epicflow" for list of available options.
An example usage is given here (set paths between <>).

matlab -nodesktop -nojvm -r "addpath(<path_to_sed>); addpath(genpath(<path_to_piotr_toolbox>)); load('modelFinal.mat'); I = imread(<im1name>); if size(I,3)==1, I = cat(3,I,I,I); end; edges = edgesDetect(I, model); fid=fopen(<edgefile>,'wb'); fwrite(fid,transpose(edges),'single'); fclose(fid); exit"

<path_to_deepmatching>/deepmatching <im1name> <im2name> -png_settings -improved_settings -out <matchfile>

./epicflow <im1name> <im2name> <edgefile> <matchfile> <outputfile> [options]
